# R project workflows

This is a non-exhaustive list of R code that assists with the workflow of R
projects. Some are R packages, others are Git repositories meant to be used as
templates, and some are guides. Here "workflow" is broadly defined, and includes
one or more of the following: file organization, dependency management (e.g.
like GNU Make), or report generation.
